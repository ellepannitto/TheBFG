TheBFG ver 0.4.1
	
	* RelationsExtractor:
		- now keeps track of vocabulary and structure frequencies. These will be necessary to calculate association measures.
	
	* Pipeline:
		- now performs merge also on vocabulary and structure files
		
	TODO:
	- change folder organization (preprocessing + data extraction + graph building + query interface)
	- handle possible common errors with parameters specification
	- find a way to generate readable documentation

TheBFG ver 0.4
	
	- major code refactoring
	- configuration files added
	- pipeline added
	- classes have been almost (!) properly commeted
		
	TODO:
	- change folder organization (preprocessing + data extraction + graph building + query interface)
	- handle possible common errors with parameters specification
	- find a way to generate readable documentation

TheBFG ver 0.3.2
  
  * MainExtractor1:
	- The script has produced a first version of the graph, as follows:
		- the portion of the corpus taken into consideration is from file 00000.gz to file 00030.gz
		- Proper nouns and named entities are normalized to the named entity tag or a placeholder such as NNP(S)
		- Among other lemmas, only those with a frequency > 1000 are taken into consideration
		- When considering an hyperedge among nodes, it may happen that some of them are low frequency lemmas. We impose that at least half of the lemma +1 are among the selected ones. This implies that binary relations are considered only when both lemmas have frequency > threshold, ternary relations when at least 2 nodes have this property and so on...
		- only sentences between 6 and 20 tokens are examined
	(the file is saved in data/graph/freq.sorted.gz file)
		
	TODO:
	- check bug in extraction of enhanced dependencies
	- implement multithreading
    - add sensible comments to the code (please forgive me for this, I'm just trying various things and commits are just to keep track of my work, I know it's not really human-readable at the moment)
    At the moment, generic associations are not printed (but the code is already implemented)

TheBFG ver 0.3.1
  
  * RelationsExtractor: 
    - The class now prints a first version of the graph, lexicographically ordered. Proper nouns and named entities have been replaced by placeholders (either PoS or NE). 
    TODO:
    - take into account frequency 
    - implement a multithreading version of the script for extraction
    - check conj relations
    - add sensible comments to the code (please forgive me for this, I'm just trying various things and commits are just to keep track of my work, I know it's not really human-readable at the moment)
    At the moment, generic associations are not printed (but the code is already implemented)

TheBFG ver 0.3.0
  
  * RelationsExtractor: 
    - implemented first version of queue to extract the graph, as described in the example (see TheBFG.md). The code selects groups of items from the parsed tree and extracts a list of items made up by: all sort of subsets from each group, labeled with their sintactic relations, pairs of items from different groups labeled with a generic association label. It still needs refinement, I just wrote down a sort of pseudocode.

TheBFG ver 0.2
  
  * LemmaFreqsExtractor: 
    - script added to extract frequencies of lemmas in the corpus, in order to set a threshold
    - the data folder has been added to the gitignore list

TheBFG ver 0.1.2
  
  * CorpusReader.py: 

  	- In the 'CorpusReader' class:

    --- Merged two lines in one in next() of 'CorpusReader'

    - In the '__main__' section:

    --- Replaced 'Reader' by 'CorpusReader'.
    --- Added stop_keys to be found in raw_input() to exit the loop.
    --- Only non empty sentences are printed.
    --- Cosmetic change to display of sentences.

  * Token.py:

    - In the 'Token' class:

    --- Added a few request for examples (for pedagogical purpose).
