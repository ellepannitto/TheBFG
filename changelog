TheBFG ver 0.3.1
  
  * RelationsExtractor: 
    - The class now prints a first version of the graph, lexicographically ordered. Proper nouns and named entities have been replaced by placeholders (either PoS or NE). 
    TODO:
    - take into account frequency 
    - implement a multithreading version of the script for extraction
    - check conj relations
    - add sensible comments to the code (please forgive me for this, I'm just trying various things and commits are just to keep track of my work, I know it's not really human-readable at the moment)
    At the moment, generic associations are not printed (but the code is already implemented)

TheBFG ver 0.3.0
  
  * RelationsExtractor: 
    - implemented first version of queue to extract the graph, as described in the example (see TheBFG.md). The code selects groups of items from the parsed tree and extracts a list of items made up by: all sort of subsets from each group, labeled with their sintactic relations, pairs of items from different groups labeled with a generic association label. It still needs refinement, I just wrote down a sort of pseudocode.

TheBFG ver 0.1.2
  
  * CorpusReader.py: 

  	- In the 'CorpusReader' class:

    --- Merged two lines in one in next() of 'CorpusReader'

    - In the '__main__' section:

    --- Replaced 'Reader' by 'CorpusReader'.
    --- Added stop_keys to be found in raw_input() to exit the loop.
    --- Only non empty sentences are printed.
    --- Cosmetic change to display of sentences.

  * Token.py:

    - In the 'Token' class:

    --- Added a few request for examples (for pedagogical purpose).
